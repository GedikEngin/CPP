## C++ Notes

The reason behind this document/folder is to help with understanding C++ in general.
Previous use and exposure was based of ESP32/MCU related usage, utilizing GPT, libraries and their documentation that I used in my projects and online forums. However now that I am progressing past the initial base, I need to have a more thorough understanding of the language, how it functions, its use cases and its implementation. I have created this folder to help me explore said topics and make notes.
